# Hack Your Maps

Web maps have come a long way. Improved data, cleaner design, better performance, and more intuitive controls have made web maps a ubiquitous and critical component of many apps. Along the way the web map has become one of the most successful transplants into the mobile space as more and more apps are powered by location-aware devices. The core web map UI paradigm itself -- of a continuous, pannable, zoomable surface -- has spread beyond mapping to interfaces everywhere.

Despite their success, web maps have barely been worked into the practice of designers. We create icon fonts, responsive grids, css frameworks, progressive enhancement strategies and revise our design process around it all. As we tear down old solutions and build new ones we take an extra second to share battle stories in prose and in person. Yet nearly five years since Paul Smith's article, *[Take Control of Your Maps](http://alistapart.com/article/takecontrolofyourmaps)*, web maps are still a blind spot for most designers.

Have you ever taken apart a map? Worked with a map as a critical part of your design? Developed tricks, hacks, workarounds, progressive enhancements for maps?

This article is a long overdue companion to *[Take Control of Your Maps](http://alistapart.com/article/takecontrolofyourmaps)*. While Paul goes on a whirlwind survey of the web mapping stack at 10,000 feet, we're going to walk through a single design process and implement a modern day web map. By walking this path I hope to show you how to blaze your own trail and make maps part of the collective conversation we have as designers.

### Opinionated about Open

Paul makes a strong case for why you might want to use open mapping tools instead of the established incumbent *([Google Maps is the best - right?](http://alistapart.com/article/takecontrolofyourmaps#section1))*. I'm not going to retread his reasons, but I would like to expand on his last: open tools are the ones we hack best.

There is nothing mysterious about web maps. Take any spatial plane, split it up into discrete tiles, position them in the DOM and add event handlers for panning, zooming. The basic formula can be applied to Portland, Mars or Super Mario Land. It is a solution for displaying large street maps but nothing stops us -- or should stop us -- from tinkering with this formula to explore galleries of art, create fictional game worlds, learn human anatomy, or simply navigate a web page. Open tools bare the guts of this mechanic to us where we can see a wider range of possibilities.

*The mechanics of web maps are not limited to street maps.*

We should know the conditions under which map images are loaded and destroyed, we should argue whether map tiles are best positioned with CSS transforms or not, and we should care whether vector elements are drawn with SVG or Canvas. Open tools let us know and experiment with these working details of our maps. If you wouldn't have it any other way with your HTML5, CSS, or JavaScript libraries, then you shouldn't settle for less when it comes to maps.

In short, we'll be working with a fully open mapping stack.

### Starting out

I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. The Hollywood movies with Robert Downey Jr. and the contemporary take in the BBC's *Sherlock* series have me hooked. But as someone who's never been to London I know I'm missing the richness of place and setting that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle meant to be read into his short stories.

A typical web map solution would be to embed a map with pins of various locations alongside one of the Sherlock stories. With this approach the map is an appendix -- a dispensable element that plays little part in Doyle's storytelling. Instead, we're going to expand the role of our map to the fullest. It will set the stage, provide pace, and affect the mood of our story.

### A tale of places

To establish a baseline for our tale, I restructured *The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans* to be told around places. I picked eight key locations from the [original text](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2346/2346-h/2346-h.htm), pulled the essential details of the mystery, and framed them out with HTML, CSS, and javascript.

[![View demo 1](step1-story.png)](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step1-story.html)

*A Sherlock Holmes story text only. View [Demo 1](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step1-story.html).*

- The story is broken up into `section` elements -- one for each key location. A small amount of javascript implements a scrolling flow that highlights a single section at a time.
- Our page is not responsive yet but it contains scaffolding to guard against bad choices that could screw us. The main text column is fluid at `33.33%` and pins to a `min-width: 320px`. If our content and design flows reasonably within these constraints we're in good shape.

Next we'll get started mapping. Initially we'll work on our map separately from our story page to focus on learning key elements of a new technology.

### Maps are data

In the world of mapping the equivalent of our abridged short story is a dataset of eight geographic points. GeoJSON, a format for describing geographic data in JSON, is the perfect starting point for capturing our data:

    [
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.15591514, 51.51830379] },
        "properties": { "title": "Baker St." } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.07571203, 51.51424049] },
        "properties": { "title": "Aldgate Station" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.08533793, 51.50438536] },
        "properties": { "title": "London Bridge Station" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.05991101, 51.48752939] },
        "properties": { "title": "Woolwich Arsenal" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.18335806, 51.49439521] },
        "properties": { "title": "Gloucester Station" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.19684993, 51.5033856] },
        "properties": { "title": "Caulfield Gardens" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.10669358, 51.51433123] },
        "properties": { "title": "The Daily Telegraph" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.12416858, 51.50779757] },
        "properties": { "title": "Charing Cross Station" } },
    ];

Each object in our JSON array has a `geometry` -- data that describes where this object is in space -- and `properties` -- freeform data of our own choosing to describe what this object is. Now that we have this data, we can create a very basic map.

[![View demo 2](step2-map.png)](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step2-map.html)

*The basics of web mapping. View [Demo 2](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step2-map.html).*

- Note that the coordinates are a pair of latitude, longitude degrees in the order `lon,lat`. In the year 2013 it is still not possible to find a consistent order for these values across mapping APIs. Many choose `lon,lat` to match `x,y`: horizontal, then vertical.
- We're using `mapbox.js` as our core open source mapping library. Each map is best understood as the key parameters passed into `mapbox.map()`:
  1. A DOM element that is a container for,
  2. One or more Photoshop-like *layers* that position image tiles, pin elements,
  3. That are manipulated by *event handlers* that bind user input like dragging or scrolling to panning and zooming.
- Our map has two layers. Our tile layer is made up of `256x256` square images generated from a custom map on MapBox. Our spots layer is made up of pin markers generated from the GeoJSON data above.

This is a good start for our code but nowhere near our initial goal of using a map to tell our Sherlock Holmes story.

### Beyond location

According to our first map the eight items in our GeoJSON dataset are just places, not settings in a story full of intrigue and mystery. From a visual standpoint, pins anonymize our places and express them purely as locations.

To overcome this we can use illustrations for each location. Some show settings, others show key plot elements. Now our audience can see right away that there is more to each location than its position in space. As a canvas for these I've created another map with a custom style that blends seamlessly with the images.

[![View demo 3](step3-markers.png)](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step3-markers.html)

*Illustrations and a custom style help our map become part of the storytelling. View [Demo 3](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step3-markers.html) and then read the [diff](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock/compare/step2-map...step3-markers).*

- The main change here is that we define a custom *factory function* for our markers layer. The job of the factory function is to take each geojson object and convert it to a DOM element -- an `<a>`, `<div>`, `<img>` or whatever -- that the layer will then position on the map.
- Here we generate `<div>`'s and switch from using a `title` attribute in our GeoJSON to an `id`. This provides us with useful CSS classes for displaying illustrations with our custom markers.

### Bringing it all together

Now we will combine our story and our map. By using the scroll events from before we can coordinate sections of the story with places on the map, crafting a unified experience.

[![View demo 4](step4-combined.png)](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step4-combined.html)

*As the user reads each section the map pans to a new location. View [Demo 4](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step4-combined.html) and then read the [diff](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock/compare/step3-markers...step4-combined).*

- The bridge between the story and the map is a revamped `setActive()` function. Previously it only set an active class on a particular `<section>` based on scrolling position. Now it also finds the active marker, sets an active class, and *eases* the map to the marker's location.
- Map animation is done using the *easey* library in the `mapbox.js` API that implements animations and tweening between geographic locations. The API is dead simple -- we pass it the `lon/lat` of the marker we want to animate to and it handles the rest.
- We disable all event handlers on our map by passing an empty array into `mapbox.map()`. Now the map can only be affected by the scrolling position. If users wanted to deviate from the storyline or explore London free-form we could reintroduce event handlers, but in this case less is more.

Displaying our fullscreen map together with text presents an interesting challenge: our map viewport should be offset to the right to account for our story on the left. The solution I'm using here is to expand our map viewport off-canvas purely using CSS. There are javascript approaches to this problem but as we'll see later a CSS-only approach gives us elegant ways to reapply and adjust this technique on mobile devices.

![Map center offset](fig2-offset.png)

At this stage our map and story complement each other nicely. Our map adds spatial context, visual intrigue, and an interesting temporal element as it eases between long and short distances.

### Maps in responsive design

The tiled, continuous spatial plane represented by web maps are naturally well-suited for responsive design. Web maps handle different viewport sizes easily by showing a bit more or a bit less map. For our site we adjust the layout of other elements slightly to fit smaller viewports.

[![View demo 5](step5-responsive.png)](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step5-responsive.html)

*Tweaking layout with web maps. View [Demo 5](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step5-responsive.html) and then read the [diff](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock/compare/step4-combined...step5-responsive).*

- With less screen real estate we hide non-active text sections and pin the active text to the top of the screen.
- We use the bottom half of the screen for our map and using media queries we can now adjust the map centerpoint to be at 3/4 the height of the screen using another version of our trick from demo 4.

With a modest amount of planning and minimal adjustments our Sherlock story is ready to be read on the go.

### Blaze your own trail

If you've been following the code between steps you've probably noticed at least one or two things I haven't covered, like the parameters of `ease.optimal()`, or how tooltips picked up on the `title` attribute of our GeoJSON data. The devil's in the details so post to this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock) where you will find the code and the design.

This example shows just one path to integrating web maps into your designs. Don't stick to it. Break it apart. Make it your own. Do things that might be completely genius or utterly stupid. Even if they don't work out you'll be taking ownership of maps as a designer -- and that's something we've needed for a long time.
