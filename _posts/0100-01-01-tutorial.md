# Integrating Fullscreen Maps Into Responsive Websites

While the technology behind web mapping has matured rapidly in recent years, the integration of maps into the design process of websites and applications has barely scratched the surface. Pioneers like [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) and [Hipmunk](http://hipmunk.com) are experimenting with maps as a critical design element -- one that establishes context, energizes space, and sets tone and mood.

Grokking the details of web mapping can be unfamiliar and challenging, but it is a huge creative opportunity for designers. As mobile devices make location more relevant to users there's no better time than the present to get started with maps.

### What's in store

This tutorial will first show you an example of how to treat a map as an essential and co-equal design element in your process. Then we'll get our hands dirty with web maps and implement one in a responsive website.

We'll be working with maps from MapBox that use open data and mapbox.js -- a fully open mapping stack. But the concepts I discuss aren't specific to the tools we'll use. The literal mapping APIs of Google, Bing, Nokia, and others differ but switching between them is like picking up Pixelmater after using Photoshop or driving a new rental car. Same, same but different.

I'll be dropping links to pieces of code that are at the heart of how web maps work. By working with open tools you'll get a chance to look inside technology that remains a black box to many.

### Enriching a story

I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. The Hollywood movies with Robert Downey Jr. and the contemporary take in the BBC's *Sherlock* series have me hooked. But as someone who's never been to London I know I'm missing the richness of place and setting that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle meant to be read into his short stories.

A typical web map solution would be to embed a map with pins of various locations alongside one of the Sherlock stories. With this approach the map is an appendix -- a dispensable element that plays little part in Doyle's storytelling. Instead, we're going to expand the role of our map to the fullest. It will set the stage, provide pace, and affect the mood of our story.

### A tale of places

To establish a baseline for our tale, I restructured *The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans* to be told around places. I picked eight key locations from the [original text](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2346/2346-h/2346-h.htm), pulled the essential details of the mystery, and framed them out with HTML, CSS, and javascript.

*A Sherlock Holmes story text only. View [Demo 1](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step-0-story.html).*

- The story is broken up into `section` elements -- one for each key location.
- I'm using [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) and a small amount of javascript to implement a scrolling flow that highlights a single section at a time.
- Our page is not responsive yet but it contains scaffolding to guard against bad choices that could screw us. The main text column is fluid at `33.33%` and pins to a `min-width: 320px`. If our content and design flows reasonably within these constraints we're in good shape.

Next we'll get started mapping. Initially we'll work on our map separately from our story page to focus on learning key elements of a new technology.

### Maps are data

In the world of mapping the equivalent of our abridged short story is a dataset of eight geographic points. GeoJSON, a format for describing geographic data in JSON, is the perfect starting point for capturing our data:

    [
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.155740,51.517998] },
        "properties": { "title": "Baker St." } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.075531,51.514084] },
        "properties": { "title": "Aldgate Station" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.087097,51.505337] },
        "properties": { "title": "London Bridge Station" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [0.055275,51.487156] },
        "properties": { "title": "Woolwich Arsenal" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.128853,51.501076] },
        "properties": { "title": "Gloucester Station" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.195951,51.502171] },
        "properties": { "title": "Caulfield Gardens" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.106832,51.514328] },
        "properties": { "title": "The Daily Telegraph" } },
      { "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [-0.123124,51.507168] },
        "properties": { "title": "Charing Cross Station" } },
    ];

Each object in our JSON array has a `geometry` -- data that describes where this object is in space -- and `properties` -- freeform data of our own choosing to describe what this object is. Now that we have this data, we can create a very basic map.

*The basics of web mapping. View [Demo 2](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step-1-map.html).*

- Note that the coordinates are a pair of latitude, longitude degrees in the order `lon,lat`. In the year 2013 it is still not possible to find a consistent order for these values across mapping APIs. Many choose `lon,lat` to match `x,y`: horizontal, then vertical.
- We're using `mapbox.js` as our core mapping library. Each map is best understood as the key parameters passed into `mapbox.map()`:
  1. A DOM element that is a container for,
  2. One or more Photoshop-like *layers* that position image tiles, pin elements,
  3. That are manipulated by *event handlers* that bind user input like dragging or scrolling to panning and zooming.
- Our map has two layers. Our tile layer is made up of `256x256` square images generated from a custom map on MapBox. Our spots layer is made up of pin markers generated from the GeoJSON data above.

This is a good start for our code but nowhere near our initial goal of using a map to tell our Sherlock Holmes story.

### Beyond location

According to our first map the eight items in our GeoJSON dataset are just places, not settings in a story full of intrigue and mystery.

- Pins anonymize our places and express them purely as locations.
- We could stuff more text into tooltips (e.g. "The home of Sherlock and Watson") but that does not address the visual problem -- all our places look the same.
- We want our audience at first glance to see setting and plot in addition to location from our places.

To accomplish this I pulled together a sprite of illustrations for each location. Some illustrations show setting, others show a key plot element. Now our audience can see right away that there is more to each location than its position in space. As a canvas for these I've created another map with a custom style that works well with my illustrations.

*Illustrations and a custom style help our map become part of the storytelling. View [Demo 3](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step-2-markers.html) and then read the [diff](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock/compare/step-1-map...step-2-markers).*

- The main change here is that we define a custom *factory function* for our markers layer. The job of the factory function is to take each geojson object and convert it to a DOM element -- an `<a>`, `<div>`, `<img>` or whatever -- that the layer will then position on the map.
- Here we generate `<div>`'s and switch from using a `title` attribute in our GeoJSON to an `id`. This provides us with useful CSS classes for displaying illustrations with our custom markers.

### Bringing it all together

Now we will combine our story and our map. By using the scroll events from before we can coordinate sections of the story with places on the map, crafting a unified experience.

[![View demo 4](step3-combined.png)](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step-3-combined.html)

*As the user reads each section the map pans to a new location. View [Demo 4](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step-3-combined.html) and then read the [diff](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock/compare/step-2-markers...step-3-combined).*

- The bridge between the story and the map is a revamped `setActive()` function. Previously it only set an active class on a particular `<section>` based on scrolling position. Now it also finds the active marker, sets an active class, and *eases* the map to the marker's location.
- Map animation is done using the *easey* library in the `mapbox.js` API that implements animations and tweening between geographic locations. The API is dead simple -- we pass it the `lon/lat` of the marker we want to animate to and it handles the rest.
- We disable all event handlers on our map by passing an empty array into `mapbox.map()`. Now the map can only be affected by the scrolling position. If users wanted to deviate from the storyline or explore London free-form we could reintroduce event handlers, but in this case less is more.
- Displaying our map fullscreen presents an interesting challenge: our map viewport should be offset to the right to account for our column of text on the left. The solution I'm using here is to expand our map viewport off-canvas purely using CSS. There are javascript approaches to this problem but as we'll see later a CSS-only approach gives us elegant ways to reapply and adjust this technique on mobile devices.

![Map center offset](fig1-offset.png)

At this stage our map and story complement each other nicely. Our map adds spatial context, visual intrigue, and an interesting temporal element as it eases between long and short distances.

### Maps in responsive design

The tiled, continuous spatial plane represented by web maps are naturally well-suited for responsive design. Web maps handle different viewport sizes easily by showing a bit more or a bit less map. For our site we adjust the layout of other elements slightly to fit smaller viewports.

[![View demo 5](step4-responsive.png)](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step-4-responsive.html)

*Tweaking the layout is easy with web maps. View [Demo 5](http://mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/step-4-responsive.html) and then read the [diff](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock/compare/step-3-combined...step-4-responsive).*

- With less screen real estate we hide non-active text sections and pin the active text to the top of the screen.
- We use the bottom half of the screen for our map and using media queries we can now adjust the map centerpoint to be at 3/4 the height of the screen using another version of our trick from demo 4.

That's it! With a modest amount of planning and minimal adjustments our Sherlock story is ready to be read on the go.

### Wrapping up 

This hands-on tutorial has covered the basic steps of implementing web maps in a responsive website. Hopefully it's also shown you the tip of the iceberg of how maps can be integrated tightly into design.

If you've been following the code between steps you've probably noticed at least one or two things I haven't covered, like the parameters of `ease.optimal()`, or how tooltips picked up on the `title` attribute of our GeoJSON data. The devil's in the details so please post any questions you have about this tutorial's code on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mapbox/tutorial-sherlock).
